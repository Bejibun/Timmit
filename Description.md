This app has 2 main functions such as calculating tax from all the price list you want to buy up to 6 items and 
you can generate the sales tax from your phone's location. 
The tip button function is for dividing equally the restaurant check. For instance, 
you are going to the restaurant with 5-6 people, 
then you get the check with the total (with tax or without tax). 
Next, you just try to click the 10%, 15%, 18% button to get the total for each person including tax and tip. 
All the sales tax value is stored locally into a local file and parsed locally using a JSON Parsing. 
Only 1 of the option you can choose either enter 2 digit zip code, or click directly to get your current location. 
Here's my own creative app.
